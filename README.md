# FairMoney Loan Defaulters' Analysis

## Introduction:
This project aims to develop a foundational understanding of risk analytics within FairMoney Financial Services, specifically focusing on minimizing the risk of financial loss while lending to customers. The analysis explores the dataset to uncover customer loan default behaviours. Understanding loan defaulters is critical for financial institutions to assess risk and make informed lending decisions. By utilizing a dataset containing information about past borrowers, including their demographics, financial history, and loan details, we aim to explore default patterns and provide actionable recommendations.

## Tools:
- Excel
- Power Query
- Power Pivot


The FairMoney Loan Defaulters analysis aims to identify defaulters and examine the relationships between defaulters' characteristics such as gender, education, occupation, income type, age bracket, and marital status. 


## Dataset:

- Analysis of defaulters by marital status shows that married females have a higher default rate compared to married males.

- Borrowers aged 30-49, particularly those with secondary level education, have the highest loan amounts, ranging between ₦47,287,004,336 and ₦51,586,502,473.



## Recommendations


# 1. Targeted Loan Offerings:

  - Focus loan offerings on borrowers aged 29 to 50, who demonstrate a higher likelihood of repayment and substantial borrowing potential.



# 2. Enhanced Loan Recovery Measures:

  - Implement stricter loan recovery protocols, such as obtaining pre-authorization to debit the borrower's credit or debit card upon loan due dates to ensure quicker loan recovery.


# 3. Strategic Allocation of Loan Recovery Resources:

  - Allocate resources efficiently by targeting the recovery of the 2.6% of the total loan amount held by defaulters while continuing to offer more loans to reliable borrowers who pay on time.


# 4. Data Collection Improvements:

  - Improve data collection accuracy by ensuring all occupation and age data are accurately recorded, particularly addressing the issue of unspecified occupations.



These recommendations aim to enhance FairMoney's loan disbursement strategy, improve recovery rates, and ensure accurate data collection for more informed decision-making.
